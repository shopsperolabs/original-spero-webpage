<h2 id="philippines-title">"Blessed to Bless" Philippines Crewneck Fundraiser</h2>
<p id="philippines-content">
	 SPERO is excited to present a new crewneck that will provide funds for relief in the Philippines. Recently, a typhoon hit the nation, one that caused a death toll of over 10,000 and washed away entire cities. We believe that we are privileged when compared to most and want to give back and bless others who are not as fortunate. So, 20% of the proceeds will go directly to the Haiyan typhoon relief through Build Hope International's Philippines fund. Thank you for your support and SPERO is blessed to bless!
