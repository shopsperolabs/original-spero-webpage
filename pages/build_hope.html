	<strong>What is Build Hope</strong>
</p>
<p id="build-hope-content">
	 Build Hope International is an organization founded by Pastor James Lee. Its mission is to BUILD orphanages and safe houses, RESCUE children caught in modern-day slavery, and RESTORE victims of slavery in countries such as Nicaragua, Africa, India, China, North Korea, and Cambodia. <br />
	 Spero is thrilled to partner with an organization that shares the same vision for social justice and a team is planning on going out into the field alongside Build Hope International in 2014. <br />
	 20% of the proceeds from Spero will be going toward a special Build Hope Dream fund in Cambodia, which pays for the college tuition for orphans. The goal is to raise $300,000 for medical school, nursing school, the police academy, and seminary school. <br />
	 Help us help them. This is where fashion meets mission.
