She dreams of the intellectual coffee talks, hectic morning commutes, and relationships she will find in being in the world of business and law (I promise that I know what I am getting myself into). She is incredibly humbled by the vision of Spero and she cannot wait to see how God will connect dreams, build hope, and move hearts with this project. Watch out, Berkeley, big things are happening!

<p class="member-bio">
	 Alyssa is a student at UC Berkeley studying Integrative Biology and Spanish language. To escape the stresses that come with being a student on the pre-med track, Alyssa likes to step back and look at the world from behind the lens. Pictures make her happy, as do her friends, family, singing, eating, and everything of the like. She is pretty affectionate, almost to the point where people get uncomfortable but what can she do? She just has a childlike spirit that loves to express itself. Helping people is what she loves to do, and she can't wait to work with the beloved Spero team.

	 David grew up in Los Angeles (Koreatown) and moved to UC Berkeley to study Business Administration. He spends most of his time studying, online shopping (but not buying anything), and working as a barista. During his free time, he especially enjoys dancing as well as spending quality time with his friends whether it’s through grabbing food, drinking boba or just chilling. His favorite foods include fried chicken and anything from Taco Bell because he really enjoys eating greasy food. David is excited to see what Spero can accomplish this year and will do whatever he can so that he can support the impact that Spero is trying to make. Talk to David, he needs friends :)

Her favorite thing to drink is oolong tea with 50% sugar, less ice, and boba. She also dances too many hours than she probably should. Angie low-key fangirled over Spero even before she started attending Cal. She is super excited to be a part of the team and continually explore the intersection of faith and fashion.

	 Justine comes from the city of San Ramon, or as people from SoCal call it, "is that near San Jose ?" When she's not struggling towards her Econ &amp; Psych majors, you can find her playing board games or making late night runs to Taco Bell with her friends. She likes going to concerts, bookmarking funny Facebook videos, and messing around with Snapchat filters. The way to Justine's heart is through clean bed sheets and Steph Curry highlights. Even though creating this About Me irrationally stressed her out, she is excited to be on the Spero team and only hopes that her journey will help her grow as a person of compassion and conviction.
